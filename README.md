# 🎃🌽 ScareCrow Cobalt Strike intergration CNA

A Cobalt Strike script for ScareCrow payload generation. Works only with the binary and DLL Loader.

### 💣 ScareCrow Available Options
```bash
-I string
    Path to the raw 64-bit shellcode.
-Loader string
    Sets the type of process that will sideload the malicious payload:
    [*] binary - Generates a binary based payload. (This type does not benefit from any sideloading).
    [*] dll - Generates just a DLL file. Can be executed with commands such as rundll32 or regsvr32 with DllRegisterServer, DllGetClassObject as export functions.
-etw
    Enables ETW patching to prevent ETW events from being generated by the process. ETW utilizes built-in Syscalls to generate this telemetry. Since ETW is a native feature built into Windows, security products do not need to "hook" the ETW syscalls to gain the information. As a result, to prevent ETW, ScareCrow patches numerous ETW syscalls, flushing out the registers and returning the execution flow to the next instruction. 
-sandbox
    Enables sandbox evasion using IsDomainedJoined calls.
